Content types
=============

By default, there are three content types:

- Page: for pages
- Blog: for blog posts
- Node: unless you are sure of what content type to use

If you think you require a new content type, you are able to create one from admin panel.

Valid Parameters
================

Supported parameters for content types:

- nodes_per_page: Expects integer value greater than 0 for pagination limit of nodes
- routes: Expects 0 or 1 for beautiful URLs like `/type-alias/node-slug`

See: :ref:`parameters`.
